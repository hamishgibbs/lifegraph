The things that need to happen:

remembering all questions that have been asked and their answers
Show if they fail to resolve with a certain change in the schema

Ensure that every change to the schema is recorded
Check that all data contains all keys (can have a type or be unknown)
Ensure that every inherited type has all the keys of its parent (recorded explicitly in the JSON to start)


add @person -> name -> string
    if type doesn't exist
        CREATED @person X
    if this property doesn't exist on this type
        ADDPROPERTY name TO @person X
        if this type is a parent of other types ADDPROPERTY to children

remove @company -> country
    if this property is not inherited from a parent
        REMOVEPROPERTY country FROM @company X

change @person -> country -> geo_container
    if this property is not inherited from a parent
    CHANGEPROPERTY country FROM @company TO geo_container X

"rename" @person -> country -> region
    this should propagate to the data

makeparent -> @human -> @child X

removeparent -> @human -> @child X

editparent -> @human -> @child X

NEXT:
    1. set up cli to edit schema files
        write command
        check command
        edit schema
        edit any other schema necessary


Then need to audit data relative to current schema (and apply changes to data when the schema is changed) X

smart copy X
search X
hierarchy
csv to graph
summary

Then need to come up with way of getting data into the schema

migration of some data to a different schema representation may be interesting at some point

TODO: you cannot edit a parent's property on a child
